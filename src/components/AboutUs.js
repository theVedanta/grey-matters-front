            Grey Matters, the quiz club of DPS Vasant Kunj, was established in
            2006 and has since evolved into a society of prestige and
            accomplishment. Grey matters is one of Delhi's most ambitious quiz
            societies. We, the members of Grey matters, follow a particular way
            of thinking-the philosophy that quizzing ultimately comes down to
            the pursuit of thought, not just that of knowledge. Itâ€™s how one
            thinks that matters, not what one knows, and the quizzers at Grey
            Matters represent the same principle in everything they do - be it
            making quizzes or winning them.What you see here, today, is the
            culmination of years of effort to rejuvenate DPS Vasant Kunj's
            vibrant quizzing culture.
